        "question": "How does Slug Store eliminate the need for databases?",
        "answer": "Slug Store represents a paradigm shift - **building persistent apps with no database has never been easier**. It bridges the gap between ephemeral state (lost on refresh) and complex databases (overkill for many apps). Your application state lives in URLs, giving you **more than state, not quite a database, but with true persistence and infinite scalability**. Perfect for everything from startup MVPs to enterprise applications.",

        "id": "scaling-architecture",
        "question": "How do I scale from zero-database to enterprise with Slug Store?",
        "answer": "Slug Store scales beautifully: **Small Apps** (100% URL state, zero backend), **Medium Apps** (user auth + URL state, minimal backend), **Enterprise** (user data in DB + complex state in URLs). You start with zero infrastructure and add databases only when you need user management - not for application state. This hybrid approach reduces costs, complexity, and vendor lock-in while maintaining infinite scalability.",

        "id": "beyond-traditional-state",
        "question": "What makes URL state different from traditional state management?",
        "answer": "Traditional state is **ephemeral** (lost on refresh), **device-specific** (can't share), and **temporary** (no persistence). Slug Store state is **persistent** (survives refreshes), **cross-device** (works everywhere), **shareable** (via URLs), and **scalable** (no server limits). It's the missing piece between useState/Zustand and full database architectures - giving you persistence without the complexity.",

        "id": "enterprise-without-complexity",
        "question": "Can I build enterprise-grade apps without traditional backend complexity?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Store user authentication in a simple database (Supabase, Auth0), then put **all application state in encrypted URLs**. This gives you: enterprise security (encrypted URLs), audit trails (state history in URLs), team collaboration (share encrypted URLs), compliance (zero data lock-in), and infinite scaling (URLs are infinitely scalable). Fortune 500 complexity with startup simplicity.",

        "answer": "Slug Store is a lightweight library that lets you persist complex application state in URL slugs. Think of it as a way to make any app state shareable via URLs - like how Excalidraw lets you share drawings or how Google Docs shares documents, but for any web application.",

        "answer": "Slug Store offers unique benefits: 1) **Shareable URLs** - Users can bookmark and share exact app states, 2) **SEO-friendly** - State is visible to search engines, 3) **No server required** - Everything works client-side, 4) **Framework agnostic** - Works with React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS, 5) **Compressed & encrypted** - Efficient and secure.",

        "answer": "With compression enabled, URLs are typically 30-70% smaller than raw JSON. For example, a complex e-commerce filter state (categories, price ranges, sorting) that's 2KB as JSON becomes ~600 bytes in the URL. Most browsers support URLs up to 2000+ characters, which is plenty for typical app states.",
